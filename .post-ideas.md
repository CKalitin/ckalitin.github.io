### The Bare Minimum Engineer
1. Play on Handmer's The Well-Rounded Engineer
2. The MVP of an engineer, providing value
3. How to be a net positive in organizations
4. J-curve of organization member productivity

### How to actually learn things and why university is inefficeint
1. Just take the conversation with Prashant and formalize it
2. Work from first principles

### Transition from Privately Owned ICE vehicles to Autonomous Robotaxis
1. S-curves (show them, and why they're the future) "S-curves are destiny"
2. Personal arguments do not matter, economics does
3. Implications (less car ownership, new auotmotive market decreases, majority of income from software, first mover advantage?, bankruptcies, adjacent technologies, other transport methods that can't compete, clean future)
4. Kurzweil quote about applying paradigms

### The Rocket Lab Master Plan
1. Bro Q3 report just came out they're actually doing so well its crazy im hyped

### Stoke's Path to Profitability and Market Dominance
1. Show the intermediary steps
2. Show why Terran 1/ABL comparisons aren't valid (There's a market, they are making technical progress, respectively)
3. Show the three stages of Nova (Prototype LEO launches, Price competitiveness with MLVs, niche launcher in fully reusable land)

### Nova cost model
1. It isn't gonna be perfect, but the shapes of the graphs should be right
2. If it's right on the edge of working, assume it won't
3. Just make the model and write about the assumptions and conclusions
4. Ozan made an interesting point about expendable launch economics that I could model here: https://x.com/BellikOzan/status/1864099464795000837

### Have Launch Costs Actually Decreased?
1. Peter Lionnet on Payload talked about this
2. Soyuz, Ariane, Delta/Atlas, Falcon
3. https://x.com/TheRTest/status/1860547305776066782
4. This too: https://x.com/TheRTest/status/1860553566185763069 - Kourou launched Soyuz was pricier?

### Breakdown of Launch & Payload Data
1. Just summarize all of my charts
2. Make more too!
3. Explain the insights from all of them
 - This is seemed that seems too obvious to do, so it's even more important

### Historic Look at Launches by Vehicle and Site
NOTE: This project is dependent on the improved workflow for charts, otherwise It'd be a useless pain putting it all together

1. What happened in 86-88 in the US?
2. Why did Soviet launches begin to decline before the fall of the USSR?
3. Why did the US scale faster than the USSR?
   3B. What were the early US and Soviet Missions
4. Why did the USSR sustain high cadence longer than the US after 1966
5. Look at the early uses of the various pads and which vehicles launched from where
6. SpaceX is visible in 2019 and after, just a cool stat

### Extrapolating future values of marginal launch cost and launch price
1. Ozan posted a little bit about this it's a good topic https://x.com/bellikozan/status/1863658831311716751
2. Marginal launch cost is falling far faster than prices, when does price catch up?

### Random Insights/Observation on The History of SpaceX
1. The Falcon 1 Thread
2. Falcon 9 V1.0 to V1.1 transition and delay of FH
3. Maybe when I'm done Reentry

### Issues with Legacy Companies Doing Reuse: Reusing too many vehicles
Ozan reply link: https://x.com/BellikOzan/status/1878615482582069558

1. You want to reuse as few vehicles as possible
2. Imagine Vulcan reusing 10 vehicles!!
3. Maybe model this out to illustrate the points? What model?

### Why Reusablility Worked This Time
1. The Cadence Fly Wheel
2. It's amortization and economics of scale, but that's too broad a term, get into the extreme details
3. Incentives aligned, not with the shuttle of other launchers
4. The cadence is here (demand model here too), show the chart (5 in 1987?!?!!)
5. The hard part is getting into extreme details on the economies of scale, which is what I should think about and focus on

### What Actually is the Market for Earth Observation Satellites?
1. I actually don't know why the data is useful?
2. Is this an anecdote situation?

### When Will Synthetic CH4 Be Economical?
1. Just think about it

### Designing a 5kWh battery pack as an Exercise
1. Here's the UBC Solar recording that prompted this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OvmwQOgJAJw

### Second and Third order effects of increasing energy use (ie. economic use)
1. The Jevons Paradox <- Holy shit copilot
2. Why is energy use actually a good thing for people?
3. The Chinese are no longer short and tiny because of this
