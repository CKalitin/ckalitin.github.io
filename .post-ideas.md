### The Bare Minimum Engineer
1. Play on Handmer's The Well-Rounded Engineer
2. The MVP of an engineer, providing value
3. How to be a net positive in organizations
4. J-curve of organization member productivity

### How to actually learn things and why university is inefficeint
1. Just take the conversation with Prashant and formalize it
2. Work from first principles

### First Principles Thinking Expressed As A Latent Space
1. The compression step is the most important thing
2. In the latent space you've derived an idea down to its essence and most basic form
3. Now, it's easy to reason about it and see how it fits into everything else
4. The generative step is how you expand your first principles insights into new ideas or useful applications
5. This blog post is an example of this process
6. Give examples of this process, maybe the Jevons post
7. It's about distilling information, compression might not be the most straightforward word

### The Solution to the Local Maximum Problem
1. You have to have faith
2. You can't be thinking oh I could find a better wife
3. If you build together and make it the best possible thing, you'll succeed
4. This is why faith is required, Faith that you'll build the best possible future - Self belief
5. Tie this into the three rules of life:
   1. Don't Die
   2. You have to be completely delusion in your abilities and have complete faith in your path
   3. Don't bullshit yourself

Maybe I applied this too early

### Transition from Privately Owned ICE vehicles to Autonomous Robotaxis
1. S-curves (show them, and why they're the future) "S-curves are destiny"
2. Personal arguments do not matter, economics does
3. Implications (less car ownership, new auotmotive market decreases, majority of income from software, first mover advantage?, bankruptcies, adjacent technologies, other transport methods that can't compete, clean future)
4. Kurzweil quote about applying paradigms

### The Rocket Lab Master Plan
1. Bro Q3 report just came out they're actually doing so well its crazy im hyped

### Stoke's Path to Profitability and Market Dominance
1. Show the intermediary steps
2. Show why Terran 1/ABL comparisons aren't valid (There's a market, they are making technical progress, respectively)
3. Show the three stages of Nova (Prototype LEO launches, Price competitiveness with MLVs, niche launcher in fully reusable land)

### Nova cost model
1. It isn't gonna be perfect, but the shapes of the graphs should be right
2. If it's right on the edge of working, assume it won't
3. Just make the model and write about the assumptions and conclusions
4. Ozan made an interesting point about expendable launch economics that I could model here: https://x.com/BellikOzan/status/1864099464795000837

### Have Launch Costs Actually Decreased?
1. Peter Lionnet on Payload talked about this
2. Soyuz, Ariane, Delta/Atlas, Falcon
3. https://x.com/TheRTest/status/1860547305776066782
4. This too: https://x.com/TheRTest/status/1860553566185763069 - Kourou launched Soyuz was pricier?
5. This too: https://arstechnica.com/space/2025/04/reusable-rockets-are-here-so-why-is-nasa-paying-more-to-launch-stuff-to-space/
6. This too: https://x.com/deltaIV9250/status/1919493822687432781
7. There's insights waiting in other nation's rockets too: https://x.com/Puzzlerook2/status/1919496437890466224
8. How much do SRBs cost? Could I go lower level and look at parts costs at a high level? https://x.com/SpaceNotJohn/status/1919772759367762207

### Breakdown of Launch & Payload Data
1. Just summarize all of my charts
2. Make more too!
3. Explain the insights from all of them
 - This is seemed that seems too obvious to do, so it's even more important

### Historic Look at Launches by Vehicle and Site
NOTE: This project is dependent on the improved workflow for charts, otherwise It'd be a useless pain putting it all together

1. What happened in 86-88 in the US?
2. Why did Soviet launches begin to decline before the fall of the USSR?
3. Why did the US scale faster than the USSR?
   3B. What were the early US and Soviet Missions
4. Why did the USSR sustain high cadence longer than the US after 1966
5. Look at the early uses of the various pads and which vehicles launched from where
6. SpaceX is visible in 2019 and after, just a cool stat

### Extrapolating future values of marginal launch cost and launch price
1. Ozan posted a little bit about this it's a good topic https://x.com/bellikozan/status/1863658831311716751
2. Marginal launch cost is falling far faster than prices, when does price catch up?

### Random Insights/Observation on The History of SpaceX
1. The Falcon 1 Thread
2. Falcon 9 V1.0 to V1.1 transition and delay of FH
3. Maybe when I'm done Reentry
4. Elon 2005 Thread

### Why Reusablility Worked This Time
1. The Cadence Fly Wheel
2. It's amortization and economics of scale, but that's too broad a term, get into the extreme details
3. Incentives aligned, not with the shuttle of other launchers
4. The cadence is here (demand model here too), show the chart (5 in 1987?!?!!)
5. The hard part is getting into extreme details on the economies of scale, which is what I should think about and focus on

### History of SpaceX NASA contracts and how SpaceX won over and over
1. Short one
2. Lay out all contracts from COTS to present
3. Show how competitors failed
4. Cygnus on Falcon??
5. Is there hope for the commerical space industry?
6. Post

### Is Success In The Set Of Possible Outcomes For Kuiper?
1. Sudoer: https://x.com/spacesudoer/status/1910338550454981088
2. Launch, satellite manufacturing, terminal manu
3. Leadership (obv)
4. Funding Sources
5. Deals with partners (airbus, etc.) why airbus guys?
6. Is profitability possible?
7. Amazon supported forever? Sad phenomenon with large companies, tie in to Handmer on TBPN talking about innovation within already successful orgs.
8. Competition?
9. Concrete list of what's in the way
10. Impact on launch market (space systems too)
11. Sued into using Falcon 9, phenomenon of bad leadership? Hilarious leadership story, literally how to fail.

### Does the Astra Business Model Work?
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_I_TS-dZdc

1. What is the business model:  
   a. Constellations are the future  
   b. Focus on the future, don't get fixated on smaller intermediary steps  
   c. A subset of constellations won't overprovision and will require smaller single/double sat launches  
   d. A ~500-1000 kg class launcher can serve this market  
   e. (almost sounds like Lapsa talking about fresh fruit to stations)  
2. Why this business model is valid:  
   a. Expectations is that you don't get consolidation (early internet example with AOL)  
   b. If each country or other groups want custom constellations, this is a useful model  
   c. (Iridium example here with spare satellites?)  
   d. It hinges on lack of overprovisioning  
3. Why don't you talk about intermediary steps?  
   a. shippable intermediaries, geohot: https://blog.comma.ai/the-unconjoined-triangle-of-success/  
   b. you do actually need to make money, prove you're worth of capital somehow  
   c. Terraform blog on this:   
      https://terraformindustries.wordpress.com/2025/03/25/no-excuses-how-to-build-scale-and-win-in-hard-tech/  
      "Terraform follows this principle by ensuring that each deployment of synthetic fuel production generates revenue,"  
      "Instead of charting a course that allows them to take smaller steps, rapidly ..."  
   d. The is contrary to the Rocket Lab model  
   e. This is the downfall of Astra  
4. Why this business model isn't valid:  
   a. The market today is not what you talked about at all!  
   b. analyze past launches of Rocket 3 and Electron, do any of them align with what Kemp said?  
   c. Look into the US military reentry vehicle launches with Anduril  

Sadly I have 170 to study for while this problem is already loaded into my mind. Oh well we'll see if i go back to it during the summer.
