Examples of successes: SpaceX, Rocket Lab
Potential Successes, right strategy: Terraform, Stoke, Comma
Failtures: Astra, Mars One
Coutner Example: Blue Origin (capital prevents death)

Rocket Lab Example - they almost follow Blue Origin's motto better than Blue Origin

1. Geohot Idea - https://blog.comma.ai/the-unconjoined-triangle-of-success/
2. Apply more broadly to startups
3. Apply to large projects where course correction is required
4. Examples of successes, failures, counterexamples

Structure:
1. Explain Shippable Intermediaries and how to apply this more broadly
2. Examples of Successes
3. Examples of Failures
4. Counterexamples
5. Conclusion

Blue Origin and other huge companies taking on huge projects are not the same phenomenon as startups, but they suffers from the same pitfalls. Terraform is a useful example here, how large companies could easily fail at what terraform is doing.

Revenue generation is fundamental to keep a startup afloat, but also fundamental to not jump the gun on huge projects, sunk cost fallacy, then die. 

What is the framework?
1. Intermediary steps on a large project (write the proof about why this is required, non-trivial, need more examples)
2. Shippable Intermediaries prove you have something useful
3. Revenue generation is a further test, and keeps you alive - if not revenue generating you are only proving your right to more investment capital

Copilot:
The shippable intermediary is a test of the market, and the revenue generation is a test of the product

Intermediary steps allow you to course correct if your vision of the future market is incorrect (Rocket Lab and Astra example!!). 

Facets of the framework:
1. Course Correction (Fundamental and most broadly applicable)
2. Revenue Generation
3. Proving your right to capital

What I need to explore more:
1. Examples, and crucially, more counterexamples
2. Why is course correcting such a fundamental requirement?

You can apply this more personally too. If you want to dropout to start a business, make sure you're the kind of person that'll actually work all day and not play video games all day because you saw a tiktok of a dropseller once.

Or, on projects you need useful intermediary steps, don't try to jump to the end. Maybe this is useful on Solar.
