All notes locations:

4. Alex Ezzat Messages

Elec issues:
1. Slaveboards
2. MDI / DRD connectors
3. Telemetry issues just before going on the track
4. Motor

Problems in order:  
1. Slave boards  
    a. Balancing in transit?  
    b. isoSPI issues again  
    c. Balancing LEDs not turning on  
    d. Solution? replace board, replace LTC, replace mosfets, resistors too maybe  
2. Wet break testing too slow (A note on integration here and the new break plate)
    a. Rewrite the notes from Alex  
3. MDI connector and inconsistent power / CAN  
    a. Car intermittently wouldn't move for an inexplicable reason  
    b. top shell hitting connector to DRD too  
    c. MDI connector bad  
    d. Tons of attempted motor reflashes to fix it? Fix what?  
4. First drive, motor power wires interferance with rotor of motor  
    a. Wire rubbing and bolt?  
    b. Multiple people heard this  
    c. Motor temperature increased (FET temp?)  
    d. Car stopped moving, after a couple minutes it continued moving  
5. Plastic deposition on motor   
    a. Try to get rid of it with IPA  
6. Get new motor from the University of Toronto  
    a. Break caliper issue comes later  
    b. Attempt to use motor stand from illini? Berkeley?  
    c. Motor initially doesn't work with our controller  
    d. It goes back and forth really quickly  
    e. Try a lot of things with Sasha (great guy)  
    f. it wasn't deterministic interferance  
    g. Give motor LCR specs  
    h. Swap hall effect sense lines around to match motor power phase lines, then it works  
    i. The motor thinks it's in reverse, 10A max, get to track.  
    j. Solve reverse issue after a few hours. (Aarjav pls expand here)  
    k. Now full power on the track! Max 75 kmph!
7. Break calipre issue  
    a. New motor from UofT has a thinner break disc  
    b. Show video  
    c. Break pad(?) falls out and stays there, stuck  
    d. Not constantly breaking on one edge of the break pad(?) and heating up  
    e. Motor FET temperature was also abnormally high  

Going to need a way to share videos here

Write another blog posts on insights from other teams

Write another one (maybe combine) about what to improve about UBC Solar, a vision for UBC Solar in 2028  
What is required for WSC 2028

Maybe write one analyzing data from comp too on Influx

I took 5,211 words of notes during comp and all are available here.
