I intend to become a citizen of the Land of Opportunity and do everything in my power to improve the nation. Albeit, until I find a place that aligns more closely with my ideals.

This is patriotism, being a net positive to your nation. I can't imagine living a net-zero or net-negative life, what's the point? Work to improve your life and the lives of your neighbors and family members. This is a fundamentally useful and positive life and everyone should strive for it. 

Without a positive framework for living you fall into the trap of working for money or working for leasure. We should teach the kids to improve the future - pessimism is Death. 

It appears religion used to serve this role. Christianity provides a good framwork for living: Love your neighbours, have faith, forive, don't be hypocritical, repent and ask forgiveness for your sins, etc. This sounds like a life I would like to live. Go full Christian!

Under athiesm you need to create your own framework. Here you can fall into traps of nihilism, hedonism, or other -isms. It's okay to just be happy! You don't need to have kids anyway, it's so hard! The future is bad anyway, why bother? Nothing we can do! Not sure of who you are, maybe you're actually a woman!

It is very difficult to create your own framework for living. Religion provides this from birth. In the absense of religion, you better hope your parents raise you well and set good examples!

‎

Back to the point: Getting good people together who want to improve their society is an amazing thing. 

This is the goal of good immigration policy. Let in the net-positives, keep out the net-negatives.

You need an efficient way to sort potential immigrants. This requires quickly judging applications and only allowing those who are accepted into your country. Quotas or lotteries miss the goal: only let in the good ones. A limit to the number of immigrants can lead to missing good people and an insecure border leads to bad people getting in.

Patriotism is a requirement for immigrants. You must want to improve the country you are moving to. Give every immigrant and 18 year old a US history test in order to be allowed to vote. 

This is the system I want to live under. I want to live in a country I want to improve and move when I find a better one.

Without patriotism, you lose your culture and the ideals of your country. 40% of people in Vancouver are immigrants and with a fertility rate of 1.1 the future of the culture doesn't look good. There are uses for multiculturalism, but it is unfortunate to lose your culture. I was driving through Surrey 3 days ago, it was very Indian.

Again, we should aspire to get like-minded people together to build a great future for their society. Patriotism > Multiculturalism.

Like many political instituions, current immigration policy in the Land of Opportunity misses the goal.

Why do I have to lie in University Admissions essays? If I were honest I'd say: "I'm not writing your idiotic essay prompt, here are 30k lines of code I've written and straight As. This proves I will be a good Comp Sci student."

Maybe the solution is political. Javier Milel gives me some hope, but I doubt that could happen in the US. Maybe there is a deep state.

There was a time in history when a new nation caused the transformation of the world to democracy. Maybe we need Mars to do the same.

What happens if the US loses its fundamental beliefs (based on Christianity). <a href="https://x.com/elonmusk/status/1740963374522069145?s=20">Zuby and E</a> believe if the West loses Christianity it is screwed. Maybe they have a point. A group of people without common fundamental beliefs is not very useful to the future. Acclerate!

This has already been a ramble and I've been watching George Hotz streams from hours while being sick and groggy.  
So, I'd like to use the end of this post to give a message my future self:

<b>DON'T BE A SELLOUT!</b>
