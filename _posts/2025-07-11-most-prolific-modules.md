<i>[Alexander The Ok's](https://youtu.be/e-n_V5iEwAs?si=8psyaMOoXeRRNlI4&t=765) Beautiful Soviet Space Station Timeline.</i>

Today Alexander The Ok released a video on the Soviet Almaz stations. In the video he said this:

"After the Almaz OPS hull, TKS cargo blocks are the second most prolific space station module design ever launched."
https://youtu.be/e-n_V5iEwAs?si=qimfddcQpEQjyInm&t=791

Look into every space station module ever launched and what they were derived from.

Tiangong, Skylab, ISS (Space Lab derived? US modules and all the international modules), Almaz/Salyut (what do I call it?).

Then, look into the future for when we might beat these records. If we count Space Lab, Starship might count too.

1. Soyuz is derived from the Almaz OPS hull, which was a military project "stolen" by OKB-1.

2. TKS was originally a crew/cargo spacecraft to the Salyut stations. TKS capsule wasn't used, but TKS cargo blocks were evolved into the Functional Cargo Block (FGB, transliterated from the Russian initialism ФГБ) which was used on Mir and the ISS.
Alexander the Ok uses FGB, I'm going before this and using TKS for the family.

3. Counting all US ISS modules as a single family, not quite right

4. Predict how long until the US segment of the ISS beats net lifetime of Russian modules

5. How long for commercial modules to beat the Russian modules? Or US modules by then.

6. Russian docking modules history
