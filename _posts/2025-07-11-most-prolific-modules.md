![I Love Alexander The Ok!!!](/assets/images/most-profilic-modules/Alexander-The-Ok-July-11-2025-Soviet-Stations.jpg)  
<i>[Alexander the ok's](https://youtu.be/e-n_V5iEwAs?si=8psyaMOoXeRRNlI4&t=765) Beautiful Soviet Space Station Timeline.</i>

Today [Alexander the ok released a video](https://youtu.be/e-n_V5iEwAs?si=8psyaMOoXeRRNlI4&t=765) on the Soviet Almaz stations. In the video he said this: "After the Almaz OPS hull, TKS cargo blocks are the second most prolific space station module design ever launched."

I was immediately and irresistibly nerd snipped by this statement and I had to write the blog post to find the tell the story of the most prolific space station modules ever flown.

### <b>TKS and Almaz</b>

First, I'll give some background on the TKS and Almaz derived station modules.

[Almaz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almaz) was a program in the Soviet Union to develop a series of space station for mainly military reconnaissance purposes. Each station weighed around 20 tonnes, had a 88cm diameter cosmonaut operated telescope (1m surface resolution), and was launched on the Proton rocket. The Almaz station was based on the Orbital Pilot Station (OPS) hull and was well into development in the last 1960s.

In 1969, with the Apollo 11 Moon landing and the Soviet Moon Rocket, the N1, failing, the Soviet space program shifted it's focus from the Moon to space stations. OKB-1 - a design bureau formerly run by Sergei Korolev - acquired ("or stole" according to Alexander the ok) several OPS hulls from the OKB-52 design bureau (They developed Almaz and the Proton rocket used to launch it). After refitting the OPS hulls with Soyuz spacecraft electronics and hardware (And renaming the station from Almaz (military-focused) to Salyut (civilian / science-focused)), the world's first space station was launched on April 19 1971.

[TKS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TKS_(spacecraft)) (Transport Supply Spaceraft) was a Soviet spacecraft designed and flown in the 60s and 70s. It was designed to carry crew and cargo to the Salyut space stations. 3 of them were launched and docked to the Salyut 6 and 7 space stations. 

The TKS spacecraft consisted of a crewed capsule and a cargo module. TKS was never launched with crew, but the cargo module was evolved into the Functional Cargo Block (FGB, transliterated from the Russian initialism ФГБ) which was used as the core modules on the Mir space station and the ISS. I'm using TKS as the name of this family of modules, and including the TKS capsules that flew to Salyut 6 and 7 in my analysis.

For a nice dry and technically dense (in a good way!) read of the early Soviet Space Program, I recommend [The Almanac of Soviet Manned Space Flight](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MJaXoLswP8IegvzsJdArlFuYwsspXGSQ3GUpiHz7nvM/edit?usp=sharing). I say dry in a good way in contrast to books like Eric Berger's Liftoff or Reentry (stories of the Falcon 1 and Falcon 9). These books are the stories of the people and stories behind SpaceX's early rockets while the Almanac is a technical history and timeline of the Soviet Manned Space Program (written in the US in the 90s!).

### <b>Overview Of All Space Station Module Families</b>

I've sorted all space station modules into seven primary families:  
1. Almaz
2. TKS
3. Skylab
4. Soviet / Russian Docking Modules
5. US ISS Modules
6. International/Commercial ISS Modules (Bigelow, ESA, JAXA)
7. Tiangong

![IMAGE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE](/assets/images/most-profilic-modules/Skylab.jpg){: .width="400"}

You've heard of Almaz and TKS now. Skylab was the US's first space station, launched in 1973. It was a modified Saturn V third stage and the final flight of the Saturn V rocket. Three crews visited the station.

![IMAGE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE](/assets/images/most-profilic-modules/Prichal.png){: .width="400"}

Five small modules were launched to Mir or the ISS as docking / small scientific modules. One of these flew to Mir, and four of these to the ISS (Pirs, Poisk, Rassvet, Prichal). All but one of these were launched on Soyuz rockets as they used the Progress spacecraft's service module for propulsion and docking to the ISS. The odd one out is Rassvet, a "Mini-Research Module" that was launched on a Space Shuttle flight.

The US ISS modules are the ones you've heard of (Unity, Destiny, Quest, Harmony, Tranquility, Cupla, Leonardo). Jared Owen has a great video on [the assembly of the ISS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FhKOuxhGlmI) which you should watch if you want to know more about these. I'm counting all of these as a single family. This isn't quite right because they aren't all based on the same hull like the Almaz or TKS modules, but it was all for the same station by the same space agency, so I'm counting them as one family.

![IMAGE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE](/assets/images/most-profilic-modules/BEAM.jpg){.width="300"}

The international / commercial ISS modules are BEAM (Bigelow Expandable Activity Module), Columbus (European Space Agency, ESA), Kibo (Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency, JAXA), and BEAM (Bigelow Expandable Activity Module). BEAM was developed by Bigelow Aerospace and launched on a SpaceX Dragon resupply mission to the ISS before they went bankrupt. It was an inflatable module.

[![IMAGE SUPPOSED TO BE HERE](/assets/images/most-profilic-modules/Tiangong.jpg){.width="300"}

Tiangong is a series of 3 Chinese space stations. The first two were small, short-lived stations that were launched in 2011 and 2016. The third one is a modular space station with three modules at the moment. [The Chinese are planning](https://www.space.com/china-expand-upgrade-tiangong-space-station) a fourth free-flying space telescope module. Very cool and we need to accelerate.

### <b>Plotting Space Station Families</b>

Source data is available in [this Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kqzgV7y3OS3aHCWXOCRws8F3FelriOv0EHpb7aWZqFw/edit?usp=sharing) and in [this repo](https://github.com/CKalitin/UBC-Solar-Leads-Gantt/tree/master/station-modules-gantt).

Look into every space station module ever launched and what they were derived from.

Tiangong, Skylab, ISS (Space Lab derived? US modules and all the international modules), Almaz/Salyut (what do I call it?).

Then, look into the future for when we might beat these records. If we count Space Lab, Starship might count too.

1. Soyuz is derived from the Almaz OPS hull, which was a military project "stolen" by OKB-1.

2. TKS was originally a crew/cargo spacecraft to the Salyut stations. TKS capsule wasn't used, but TKS cargo blocks were evolved into the Functional Cargo Block (FGB, transliterated from the Russian initialism ФГБ) which was used on Mir and the ISS.
Alexander the Ok uses FGB, I'm going before this and using TKS for the family.

3. Counting all US ISS modules as a single family, not quite right

4. Predict how long until the US segment of the ISS beats net lifetime of Russian modules

5. How long for commercial modules to beat the Russian modules? Or US modules by then.

6. Russian docking modules history

Structure:
1. Background on TKS and Almaz
2. Gantt chart of all modules
3. List all module families
4. Give some details on each one
    a. Counting US as one
    a. Russian docking modules
5. Charts of net lifetime
6. What it'll take to beat these records
