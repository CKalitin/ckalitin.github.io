You can tell I wrote this code by hand due to the intrinsicly human artisanal nature of the code. Hand made, no machine involvement, pure craftsmanship. (tl;dr code is shitty)

1. Explain why to make Mars round
2. Explain issue with the local flat Earth cartesian approximation (first, understand why it fails)
3. Explain how to rewrite using polar coordinates
