org issues

Org issues, they don't divide by projects, no one takes ownership of individual system
Mech team is 6 people, most freshmen

Each system has a few sub projects (eg. breaks), eveyrone on mech team at some point works on a part for the breaking system, so all equally responsbile and none high level experts.

Lack operations team

Every member is technical, no bus or marketing

No logistics leadership or psonsorship comms

Lots of time figuring out stuff that feels like its easy (hotel or trailers).
This kills you on races

3 number one take aways:
1. "Reliablity is king"
They swapped tires to supposedly better system, never used before, told it was better, past system did work and they knew this.
Forewent a working system for something greater, paid a price here
2. Must test everything new in the car
"Do not put anything into a race scenario that you have not tested on your car."
They ran the tires on the rear and thought it was fine to put those same ones on the front, didn't test until at comp

yea
