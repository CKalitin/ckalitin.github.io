And I'm Christopher Kalitin of the Battery Management System Subteam

Alex what went wrong with the motor and wheel at the end:

New motor rotor (Breakdisc) was thinner than the previous one, so wrong size caliper.
Caliper pistons had to move a lot farther, so they're get stuck when trying to retract? 
Tried thicker pads and worked on jacks, but not on ground

Could have tried shimming the pads more
Would have had to take off the motor though, would have been a pain and there was too little time before leaving

Alex stayed up that night to put in new pads and shim it a bit, so would've ran out of time

In a turn the body rolls, so wheel hits the wheel well
The suspension was made stiffer so it wouldn't hit
Then to get more weight on front it was made softer, safer for breaking
Then never again made it stiffer

"The suspension was fine, it's just the wheel wells weren't sized properly."
Could make it taller, might interfere with aeroshell.

A wheel well that conforms to the wheel would have to be mounted to the upright, this is for next gen car bc don't want to redesign upright.

Design assumption: Suspension means wheels move 2 inches max in a bump
Alex and Kaz think it was moving more

Account for this by assuming the shock can bottom out and nothing hits the wheel in this case. Ensure nothing will contact.

Kaz: The sink hoel was a wide but short turn, lots of roll, not too stable
"I could hear and smell the plastic melting away."

No PLA at next comp if possible.
Or any PLA under load.

All spare module sheet cell holders and PLA, all in car are PETG.

Windsheild cracked because of the heat. Remember we took off the tint too. 
Polymer chains have more freedom to move in the heat. Could heat treat so the chains unstress themselves. More characterization!
Thermal forming is nice but no way to do this in house, outsource maybe.

See video Alex sent.
The end of the break would fall out and no long be parallel to the break pad, so it's stuck there because it has too much room to get out.

New base plate for both pedals was installed sunday, last minute.
Hence, no one noticed the interferance with the accelerator potentiometer.
It was last minute because it was designed to be CNCd but IGEN shop was down for a while.
Alex was prepared to not install the new base plate, then Liam Andrew, only IGEN here, came back and manufacturer last minute.
This is why we saw him in the bay right before comp.
Better to design for water jetting or manual machining. Access to a CNC machine is difficult.
Liam Andrew designed it, it required machining from both sides and different fillet sizes so tool changes required. Strange radius.
"It could have been made simpler." - Alex

MDI connector wasnt supported in any way.
Remember the MPPTs overheating and look at data with Aarjav and Michelle.
Did the DRD cables actually get caught between bulkhead and top shell?

The motor wire was only caught in the last minute before track, our first time on the track! 
"So any time there's any risk, it should be fixed. No risk is worth overlooking."

Base plate caused issues with the breakline, the breakline was pinched because of this.
It was between the master cylindar mount (cylindar for compressing break fluid) and between the tab which holds the base plate.
Hydralic hose was caught between the two.
Not caught until after inspecting everything after seeing breaking issues.

We also didn't consider just how much the car shakes while driving.
Should have done a thorough wire check before and after driving.

"In ASC you're driving on these roads [highway], these roads are worse than the track it should be designed to withstand that."

In enclosure DRs Saman brought up strain relief on the wires. "It was brought up, just never followed through."

"People need to be told. Like in the gneeral meeting the first one back, this all needs to be explained."

"Mischa was adamant that the boards should not have water proof enclosuseres because it would be hard to debug. He said the aeroshell should be sealed."

Towing was annoying because the canopy has to be taken off.
Nylock nuts were put on, so a wrench set was required to take the canopy off.
Not ideal, if your on the track you can't get towed without a wrench set.

Also, the canopy shifted somehow and the canopy was very difficult to open.

Solutions:
Towing hard point somewhere else, easier to remove canopy, or open canopy backwards.

The glue in the control board peg sheared so the bolt wasn't hard. It freely rotated inside the 3d print so you can't get the nylcok off.
"So I told them don't put the nylocks on just put regular screws. (Before the last run)(Wrong) they already put the nylock on and it just sheared."

Sheared right after the finalized impound scrutineering. Right before we went to electrical for sealing the pack with fishing wire.
They put a nylock on then and couldn't get it off.

Also it was super messy all the time, only like 2-3 times we cleaned up.

There should be 1-2 assigned chefs - Kaz

"I wanted to keep the team smaller, but honestly I think 20-23 people is good."

Role deligator is a good role but need someone with more life experience - Kaz
She did a good job and tried her best

Peoples availablity is hard because you need to keep assigning roles.
She assigned people who didn't sleep at all because she didn't know.

This is important to solve for next time!!!

Need someone with a big stomach buying food 
"I thought I over bought but every time it was barely enough." - Kaz

Initially no dish cleaner role, should make this a role.

More hierarchy?

Wills grandpa was like the only one that did a corner shift for us. - Julie

A few people suggested a removable top shell for easier working on the car. And removable top shell and battery for charging.

Daybreak had a remoable top shell and it was a pain to remove it - Alex
It had metal tabs that kept falling it, not all aligned

The hinge wasnt too stiff, helped with aligning things but still not great.

New hinge was lighter weight but worse than last hinge.
Latches were slightly nicer but broke a few times - Julie

This year we barely passed body and sizing, Kaz had to slouch to pass it. This is driver size.
The seat got a bit taller.

This wasn't a big consideration during DRs, just breifly.
"I think a probelm is the driver model is shit. It's just not accurate to a himan body. This has been mentioned many times, the driver model should be changed. Never gt to it though." - Alex

U of T, one of their suspension rod ends snapped.
They were using washers 3-4 of them as spacers and it dug into the rod end and it snapped.
They should have used conical washers instead. - Kaz
Lead said they should have changed it but didn't.

Mech stuff is super annoying to disassemble. Took Aelx all night to change the break pads. Design for disassembly.

Pivot Washers.

Berkely had a control arm that snapped? 

Regular washers stzcked up, theres a spherical bearing inside the rod end, and the washers are on eitehr side of the spherical bearing.

Spherical beraing _______ Rod

Washers

Now if washer to rod angle decreases, the washers dig into the rod.

"Must have fat washers."

The better solution is a conical washer (Pivot Washer).

When designing stuff go through the range of motion and make sure nothing is interfering.

Better next year to ask about people's issues too, not just about design.

Florida had issues with the canopy. When pushing open, it'd fall back down. Not enough friction to keep it up.
Couldn't egress because it'd just fall back down.

Last year STanford got on the track on the last day. Mech issues, improperly sized break lines.
