Over provisioning is less possible for smaller constellations (not spacex) Chris Kemp

"If you are flying thousands of satellites in a constellation and you have the ability to replace satellites and upgrade and augment planes as needed, from a capacity standpoint that's that's going to be more efficient than just overprovisioning the entire constellation by 5%."

"Right because that's hundreds of satellites that you're having to pay for launches and pay for hardware"

"SpaceX is is obviously just continuously flying and upgrading and replenishing but not every constellation will not have that luxury. They're not going to have the the capital that SpaceX has to just overprovision everything all the time and continue to iterate."

"The other constellations are are being a lot more thoughtful about capacity planning and that's where we can we can really help"

"The other thing is let's not assume that every constellation is going to meet a homogeneous vertically integrated constellation"

(early days of internet exmaple where AOL and others were vertically integrated networks)

"But I think what countries will increasingly want is a model much more akin to the traditional telecommunications model where you're going to want to own and operate satellites just like you own and operate your fiber and your your cellular and your other data centers"

"When Microsoft Azure and cloud services enter a country they typically ask uh the country asks for the data center to be local so that the laws of that country can govern the data stored in that country."

"And those countries will want to probably launch and control access to space So if something you know is is able to prevent them from um replacing those satellites they're going to want to have a launch system capable of launching a couple of dozen satellites pretty quickly"

"I love being a private company because it's just so efficient. The overhead of everything we had to do to operate a public company that manufactures hardware was incredibly costly and it created not only a lot of expense that we couldn't maintain but it just it really slowed us down and we're going fast again."

"I think we had a dozen of them [Rocket 3s] on the production line but we also knew what was coming. We knew that the communications constellations were driving the requirement well beyond the 100 kilogram capacity that rocket 3 could could perform."

"So would we continue to invest in rocket 3 but then lose the the overall market? Because we knew we were selling satellite engines to all these companies So we knew the satellites were all 500 kg satellites and so the team started to work on rocket 4 while we continued to to launch rocket 3s and you saw what the result of that was. We had four commercial launches. Two failed two were successful. That's not good enough."

slightly illegible here, good examples of how not to talk, you need high energy all the time forever

"What we chose to do was stop spending money on a program that was causing launch failures causing our customers to lose trust in us, focus on delivering the engines to our customers - because we had sold hundreds of satellite engines - and then uh really focus all of our energy on rocket 4."

"I like to use the Model 3 as an example. If you look at the Model 3 that is a beautiful machine, it is both inexpensive but also very reliable. So you don't have to equate something being simple and inexpensive with being unreliable. So what we aim to do is build a very simple rocket but design it so that it could be produced on a production line at scale. Now the problem is you have a chicken and egg. Do you have the money to build the production line or not because you can design a Model 3 to be stamped out on Gigapresses but if you can't afford a Gigapress well then this is just a piece of paper."

"So what we did do - and I'm proud of this - is we did follow through on the investments needed to actually deliver the rocket that we had designed which is rocket 4. So as you see the tanks that we've been testing, the stages they've been passing qual which means that those exact exact stages are going to be made on the exact equipment with the exact manufacturing processes that we're using. And that thing can make a rocket a day. It's incredible. And so we we've now we're a company that has made the capital investments needed to drive the cost of the rocket down. We just need to finish all of the development and testing of the thing to make sure that it is reliable when we launch it again."

Still falling for the high manufacturing rate trap? What is this shit? Why?
