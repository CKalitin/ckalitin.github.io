Rocket 3 did test flights like starship?
Some didnt have payloads

Holy fuck
Which customers though? Small sat constellations?
“We would max out maybe at around 75 to 100 kilograms of capacity. We saw satellites that were largely four or 500 kilogram satellites dominating the road maps of all of our customers.”

“we need to get a Rocket that has product market fit, that could fly the vast majority of satellites, Kuiper satellites. A lot of our customers were making larger Earth observation satellites with larger apertures, synthetic aperture radar satellites.”

Kuiper? Earth Obv at 500 kg?! I need to talk to someone!!!!!!!!!!!!!
“The whole market was moving to 500 kilograms”

Huh?
“And if you look at our competitors like Rocket Lab, flying on order of a few hundred kilograms for now 12.5 million dollars,” 

Edit:
$12.5 M was probably for firefly

“We had four commercial flights, two succeeded, two failed, but it didn't matter because the rocket was too small.”

“There's a balance between what you saw Blue Origin do, where they spend tens of billions of dollars in decades, and then they had a first orbital flight that was a success.”

““Now, you could also just throw a rocket together and launch it and you would fail every single time.”

They got Chris Thompson and chief engineer of new Shepard?!

“So, Rocket 4 is going to be incredibly reliable.”

20x more effort into rocket 4 than 3, hundreds of millions

“So we've been practicing this new rigor that we have in manufacturing because making a satellite engine and making a rocket engine is the same thing, right? You have electronics, you have high tolerance components, you have a supply chain, you have manufacturing execution, you have... So the discipline that we have maintained in our satellite engine business, we don't have to relearn how to scale rocket production.”

“Astra is going to come back in a really interesting way because we have no debt.
We've been running the business, you know, basically on cash flow from operations from our satellite engine business.”

“it has never been done before. No founder of a company has ever taken a company, run as a public company, and while being the CEO and chairman and board member of the company, has ever led a take-private successfully, without a private equity or a bankruptcy or something."

“My instincts were right on a few things. I brought in executives from other companies, and I let them do it their way.
And the board encouraged me to do that. I said, Chris, you know, you brought in someone who needed to run things, let them run things. Those are the people I should have fired earlier”

Went public for $2B, up to 4-5B, bought back for $15M

The board pitched the company to dozens of investors

Anyone else could have bought Astra, just a bit more than $15M

“I think the thing that we really learned was, you know, this idea that 95% reliability was okay, was wrong, because if you take that internally and your teams internalize that, if well the engine can be 95% reliable and then the avionics can be 95% reliability and then the stage structure can be 95%. You end up with the overall system being like 0% reliable”

The biggest change with rocket 4:
“The team's internally focusing on making that flight successful this time, not flying something that may or may not work.”

Rocket 4 is all turbo pump fed engines

First stage engine is 3d printed using a new nasa copper alloy

“So we've scaled the volume by 100x, the payload mass by 10x, and we kept the price the same.”

The entire launch site can be packed  into shipping containers, don’t even need electricity or water??

The con ops is to drop a space port onto any austere island and launch in like a day
DOD contract to put drones in the rocket and deliver it to the other side of the planet in 45 mins

$7,500 $/kg on par with rideshare

“what we want, if you're a commercial operator and you want to launch a constellation, you want us to help support maintaining a constellation, we want to be able to go and do a direct orbital insertion for what you would otherwise have to wait for being dropped off at SunSync in 2027 on SpaceX would cost.”

“at one point, you were buying propulsion from the likes of like a Firefly. Are you still doing that or is the engines completely in house?
Yeah.
They stopped wanting to sell us anything. So we have IP and our own first stage engine that we've developed.”

“So what I'd like to do is have a factory that can make hundreds of rockets per year and a rocket that we can manufacture like soda cans occupy the, we can launch anything, any time from anywhere market. And because that is uncontested, no one can do that.”

“There are many other countries that have space programs that want to be able to launch their own satellites and have sovereign control over space access. We have an administration that would love to see American space technology and rocket technology be what the world uses to get to space. It is much easier to do that if you can put rockets in shipping containers and send them via container ship, via train, via airplane.”

“because now we're going to have a reliable system that we can manufacture at scale, that we can transport anywhere, and we are 10 times cheaper than Rocket Lab.
So if there is any notion of price elasticity demand, like also we can address the entire market, right?”

“check my math here, but I believe that if you look at the entire manifest of Rocket Lab, they've never flown more than about 200 kilograms per launch. So that indicates that if we can launch 600, that's three times the capacity at one-third of the price.”

“There's almost 10x better economics. So Neutron better work, and also Starship is not mobile, nor is Relativity. So I think we fill a really important niche here, where we can talk about our defense contract.
But I'm really excited about millions of drones, and thousands of rockets, and hundreds of locations being a key part of our national defense strategy.”

On rocket lab:
“our focus is working system means you are worth a lot. An unreliable system, you saw what happened to us, right?”

“repeatability is the key to reliability.”

“So you can't prototype a rocket and then raise billions.
You're going to redesign the rocket again. If your strategy is to raise a bunch of money, get to orbit, and then figure out how to scale your rocket, you'll fail because you're redesigning the rocket”

Satellite engines carried Astra
They retained every customer and ordered more in the worst times of Astra

100% successful working on orbit engines, 75-100 shipped

“the DoD loves us. 100% of our DoD launches have been successful.
NASA hates us. 100% of our NASA launches failed”
He finished sentences in “right?” A lot

“How many companies have failed once and then failed? Like, 100% of the other rocket companies.
The only rocket companies that have worked are the ones that do not give up. SpaceX didn't give up. They launched and failed.
They launched and failed. They launched, right?” 

“The DoD has been all in. And I really appreciated their partnership and their support.”

They raised $80M since the take private

Everybody converges on end to end

“we're going to take what we've learned from making satellite engines, we're going to make other satellite components, and then we're going to make satellites, and then we're going to have a vertically integrated space tech space systems company.”

“And people don't realize this, but we'd never been to the pad at Cape Canaveral.
It was just, you didn't even have electricity. We went and we set up the entire thing at Cape Canaveral and we launched in seven days.”

“Didn't work, but it was the same system that successfully delivered multiple orbital successes in Kodiak.”

“Our customers are raising a lot of money and our customers want more from us. They want to order hundreds of satellite engines from us.
They want launches from us. So we're raising because there's a massive amount of demand that we need to staff up to meet because everybody else has raised money.”

“So I looked at what SpaceX was doing and I said, there is no way we're going to go build a rocket that is going to directly compete with SpaceX.”

“So the question that Adam and I asked was, is there something that is completely complementary to what they're doing over at SpaceX”

“And the only thing we got wrong was, we could have made a larger rocket that fits in a shipping container on day one.
It would have needed turbo pumps.”

“And so we made the calculation that let's make the biggest rocket that we can use electric engines to propel at a certain price point.”

Adam is a legit MIT rocket scientist and a great co founder, never waivered

“Mike Judson, he built the first-stage engine for our previous rocket. All of those engines worked. The only one that didn't work was when the rocket separated and we had a fuel escape from the QD, and it caused a small explosion to cause a piece of metal to sever one of the electrical lines to one of those engines, and it shut down, as you'd expect to do, and the rocket hovered, went sideways, and then it returned on its course to orbit, and was terminated by the range safety officer, like Rocket Lab's first flight, by accident.”

“So the flight, the infamous flight where the rocket was traveling sideways, you would have made orbit if the range safety officer did not determine flight?

Absolutely. Every piece of data from that flight and from every flight subsequent to that flight indicates we would have. We thought maybe we wouldn't have had the battery capacity with the four remaining engines to do it, but subsequent flights indicated we did.”

“I think that I was too tolerant of people that I knew were not the right people, and they weren't performing, and I'm a lot less tolerant of that”

“I personally recruit everybody that we hire. No one comes in this door that I haven't interviewed.

And it's because that's the thing that we didn't do. You know, we brought in people that, you know, just frankly, the culture wasn't cohesive because we tried to scale too fast.”

“You look at the end game here, and if we can make a system that we can put in dozens of different countries, in hundreds of different, I want hundreds of spaceports. I just want a daily launch. Like, we're the only company that is positioned to democratize American space technology.”

“Like the aviation industry in last century began with companies that, you know, were able to fly airplanes and land them on dirt air strips. The dirt spaceport is perfect for Astra. So, like, I think, I love the vision of Starbase is everywhere, but it's going to start, like, you don't start with an international airport. You start with a dirt airstrip.”

“So if you're giving a blank check to anybody to start competing with us today, best case, they have a system like ours in a decade.”

“if you can avoid being a public company is the goal to avoid it.

Absolutely. What I've learned is if you have investors that believe in your company, SpaceX has found a way through a lot of different vehicles to allow private investors to get on their cap table through SPVs directly. And what I learned about being a public company is that it is enormously expensive and distracting because your board and your management team is focused on compliance.
It's focused on controls. It's focused on proving compliance and controls and audits and publishing the financial statements perfectly on time so you don't have restatements and it's not about running the business well. It's not all of your focus gets turned on into reporting and controls”

“I think about this, a rocket business is like a rocket, right? Where it is almost impossible to invest enough capital to make the thing work and scale it. And therefore, any additional overhead is like mass on a rocket that is working against you.”
